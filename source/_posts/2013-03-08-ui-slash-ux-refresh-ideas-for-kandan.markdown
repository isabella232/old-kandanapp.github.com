### A general overview of how to fix some things in the layout.

<!-- more -->
* Having the channels in a scroll area as opposed to a tabbed area allows for there to not be a limit on number of channels in one network. Tabs bunch up when there are too many channels.
* The people area should have it’s own space. This allows for better visibility of who is in the room when there are a lot of people connected. It also adds focus to the area instead of it just being a general module. Knowing who is in the room is a pretty important feature and should not be lumped into the same category as a module.
* The module area is for tools that are available to the room. I could imagine all kinds of tools that could go on this “toolbelt”.
* The chat area has not changed at all except for a slight reduction in it’s width.

### An overview of the module / “toolbelt” area.

Having module icons in a tool area is compact and allows for more freedom when making potential future modules.

### The People area

{% img /images/ui_ux_3.jpg %}

The people area is basically the same except that it gets it’s own area. I also think there should be a small area under the name dedicated to any data that needs to be displayed such as status.

### The Channels area

{% img /images/ui_ux_4.jpg %}

The channels area is basically just a list of available channels. I didn’t include a channel delete button anywhere because I think that the admin should be the only one to create and delete channels. I think this is important because a troll could potentially get in and delete all the channels. You could also figure out how to not let trolls in.

### Other Suggestions

* I think that the the sound and notifications should be set under the user settings.
* The area for the logo should be a little bit bigger. People like to brand the tools they use.
* I think that the twitter bootstrap default styles should not be changed. People should be able to make skins/themes.
* An upload media button would be cool sitting right next to the submit button in the chat box.
