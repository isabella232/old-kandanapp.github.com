The Kandan Team is pleased to announce the Official 1.0 release of [Kandan](https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan) an Open Source alternative to HipChat.

What is Kandan? Kandan is a private chat service for your company or team. You can invite colleagues to share ideas and files in a persistent group chat room or rooms.

Unlike HipChat or other alternatives, Kandan is completely Open Source and can be hosted internally or externally by your organization or by a third party.

### What's New in 1.1
These are the major changes that are now in 1.1

 * Added an Adminstrative Console. This is very basic at the moment but will allow any admin to set the max number of rooms, set a Kandan installation as public or private, and will perform basic user management. 
 	* {% img /images/kandan_1.1_admin.png %}
 * Room names have been added as unique. An error is now shown if a user tries to create a room with a name that's already in use. 
 	* {% img /images/kandan_1.1_rooms.png %}
 * We've extended the emoticon plugin to support the full [emoji set](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) 
 	* {% img /images/kandan_1.1_emojis.png %}
 * Added Desktop notifications. This will work out of the box with Chrome or Safari. If you're using Firefox you will need to install [HTML Desktop Notifications](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/html-notifications/) 
 	* {% img /images/kandan_1.1_notifications.png %}
